A cool read me for initial check in.

The app has three sections, backend, frontend, batch

Backend:
    Handles database transactions.

Frontend:
    UI for store.
    Bring your own assets.

Batch:
    Processing of etsy products for building and updating inventory.
    Bring your own api credentials.
